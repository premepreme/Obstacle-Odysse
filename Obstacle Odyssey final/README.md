## How to play Obstacle Odyssey game
![](/img/forREADME.png)

The objective of this game is for players to navigate through randomly generated obstacles while attempting to survive for as long as possible. The game becomes increasingly difficult as the player progresses, as the speed of the game increases.To start the game, the player must click on the start button. During gameplay, the player can jump by pressing the **shift key** on their keyboard once, or perform a double jump by pressing it twice. Additionally, players can lie down by pressing the **spacebar**.

Players have a total of 5 lives, which will decrease by 1 each time they hit an obstacle. The game is over when the player loses all of their lives. The game features two types of items to aid players: barrier and heart items. The barrier item can protect the player from obstacles for 3 seconds. If a player collects a barrier item and hits an obstacle, the player will not lose a life. On the other hand, the heart item grants players an extra life, but the player's life limit is set at 5. If a player already has 5 lives and collects a heart item, it will have no effect.
